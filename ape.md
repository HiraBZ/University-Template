# Tao Learning's Augmented Pedagogic Engine (APE)

The Augmented Pedagogy approach, as implemented by Tao Learning's Augmented Pedagogic Engine (APE), is a method that engages learners in their daily lives and infuses learning into their daily routine. The goal is to change the environment in a way that naturally causes learning to happen.

## Pedagogical Approach

The pedagogical approach of the DreamQuest program is a combination of various methods, including:

- Flipped Classrooms: A method in which traditional classroom instruction is reversed, with students learning new material at home and completing homework in class.
- Student-Centered Approaches to Learning: A method in which students take an active role in their learning and are given the opportunity to explore and discover new knowledge.
- Montessori schools: A method that emphasizes self-directed learning and allows children to learn at their own pace.
- Forest Schools: A method that combines outdoor education with traditional classroom instruction.
- High-Tech Approaches to Learning: A method that uses technology, such as digital tools and platforms, to enhance the learning experience.
- Logotherapy, Existential Analysis: A method that emphasizes the importance of meaning and purpose in life and helps students to find their own meaning.
- Inquiry-Based Learning (High Tech): A method that emphasizes asking questions and making discoveries to learn new information.
- Personalized Learning: A method that tailors the learning experience to the individual needs and strengths of the learner.
- Expeditionary Learning using Internships, Trips, and Job Shadowing: A method that combines classroom instruction with real-world experiences and mentorship.

## Augmented Education

The concept of augmented education is to enhance the traditional learning experience by incorporating technology and other tools to create a more immersive and interactive learning environment. This can include virtual and augmented reality, gamification, and other interactive elements.

## Summary

The Augmented Pedagogy approach, as implemented by Tao Learning's Augmented Pedagogic Engine (APE), is a method that engages learners in their daily lives and infuses learning into their daily routine through a combination of various pedagogical methods such as Flipped Classrooms, Student-Centered Approaches to Learning, Montessori schools, Forest Schools, High-Tech Approaches to Learning, Logotherapy, Existential Analysis, Inquiry-Based Learning (High Tech), Personalized Learning and Expeditionary Learning using Internships, Trips, and Job Shadowing. Additionally, the concept of augmented education is incorporated by enhancing the traditional learning experience through the use of technology and other tools to create a more immersive and interactive learning environment such as virtual and augmented reality, gamification, and other interactive elements.

The goal of this approach is to change the environment in a way that naturally causes learning to happen, and provide students with a holistic learning experience that meets their individual needs. The program is designed to be adaptable to multiple programs within the organization and to prepare students for the Future of Work.

To research and evaluate the effectiveness of these methods, and to make recommendations for the best approach to use for our program, it's also important to identify potential challenges and develop strategies for overcoming them.
