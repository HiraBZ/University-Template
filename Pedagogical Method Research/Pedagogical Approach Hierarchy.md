# Pedagogical Approach Hierarchy

The first focus that should be Pedagogical method and how to create a strong pedagogical method that the AST Program will sit inside of.
We need to create a strong pedagogical approach which will bring confidence that we can put multiple programs inside the pedagogical approach we use.

As discussed earlier this approach needs:

1. Curriculum Overview
2. Curriculum Design
3. Grading System
4. Performance Metric System
5. Syllabus Design
6. Student Guide
7. Teacher Guide 

We will rely on GitHub for our performance metrics substantially
We also will use a proprietary "Reels" system for watching content & getting credit for showing up to class by watching Reels.Â 
Then, we will have SMILE Method with Timmsi Internships as the last piece of the puzzle

So, multiple main areas will be:

## DreamWave
  * Create your Ikigai
  * Learn the Unalome
## Curiosity Camp
  * 6-Month free bootcamp
  * Learn our pedagogical approach
  * Ignite your curiosity
## FocusPass
 * Focus App
   * Track your progress
 * Focus Hive
   * Work with Teams
## Jivva & Jaivai Magazines
  * Reels System
  * Similar to FlipGrid.com
  * Similar to TikTok, but tracked for education purposes & content around education
## Xpress Lab 
  * Git Commits
  * Maybe purchase XpressLab.org for this??
## Timmsi (SMILE Spaces Partnerships)

## What is Pedagogy?
Pedagogy is the approach taken to teaching and involves both theory and practice. It involves taking into consideration several different factors: teaching styles, learning theories, understanding and student needs, feedback and assessment. Pedagogy in teaching can lean towards two ends of the spectrum: teacher-centred or student-centred.

## Create a list of various names and then one full description for a pedagogical method consisting of the following:
1. Forest School Learning
2. Flipped Classroom
3. Student-Centered Approach
4. Logotherapy
5. High-Tech Approach
6. Kinesthetic Learning with Technology
7. High Tech Inquiry-Based Learning
8 Expeditionary Learning using Internships, Trips, and Job Shadowing
9. Personalized Learning
10. High Tech and Low Tech Game-Based Learning
11. Universal Design for Learning

## Workflow for pedagogical study approach 
1. US Government
2. US Department of Education
3. HLC Accreditation
3. Tao Learning
4. Hackney University
5. AST Program

## The most important questions that we need to work on are:
1. We need to ask what is the starting point and what is the end point?
2. Who is top authority?
3. Who is the ideal student?
4. Who is the Highest Authority?
5. Who is the End User?

## We need to work on the following plan
* Why we need 16 guides?
* Because we need to make curriculum.
* Why we need curriculum because we need to make AST Program.
* Why we need to make AST Program?
* because we need to make Hackney University?
* Why making Hackney University?
* Because Hackney university is funding AST Program

## Breakdown of students for study program
1. 100 students would be coming from Third world country.
2. 200 students would be from rich countries 
3. Rest of the students are going to be Americans (middle income families)
4. We will be teachimg Tec based students
5. We will be teacing Quantum intelligence program
6. Set higher expectations for themFocus on career 20 years from now.
